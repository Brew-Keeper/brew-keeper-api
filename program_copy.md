Brew Keeper

Brewing coffee with an AeroPress has so many possibilities that it can be overwhelming to keep track of what works and what doesn't for each type of coffee bean.

Brew Keeper provides a way to *_create_*, *_brew_*, *_refine_*, and *_store notes on_* coffee recipes so you can zero in on your best brew. Recipes store all of the relevant components, including each step involved. This site was designed with the detailed AeroPress process in mind and can easily support less-involved brewing equipment.

The "BREW IT" function guides the user through each step of their brewing process. Additionally, they can enter brew notes and rate their recipe.
