Brew Keeper

Brew Keeper is an invaluable tool for coffee lovers
who desire to brew perfect cup of coffee.

Users can read, create, sample, edit, rate and clone
coffee brewing recipes. Geared toward users of the
AeroPress which has very precise brewing steps, it
can be used with any method of coffee preparation.

The "BREW IT" button counts down through each step of
the brewing process and enables the user to exactly
replicate the recipe.  After brewing, they can enter
brew notes and make a personal rating of the recipe.
They can also adjust the steps, times, and ingredients
for the next brewing until they have perfected their
recipe.
