Brew Keeper

Brew Keeper is an invaluable tool for coffee lovers who desire to brew a perfect cup of coffee.

Brew Keeper provides a way to *_create_*, *_brew_*, *_refine_*, and *_store notes on_* coffee recipes so you can zero in on your best brew for each bean. Recipes store the detailed components of coffee recipes, and general notes can hold any additional information that you might not have a place for. This site was designed with the AeroPress in mind, but can easily support other brewing equipment.

The "BREW IT" button counts down through each step of the brewing process and enables the user to exactly replicate the recipe.  After brewing, they can enter brew notes and make a personal rating of the recipe.  They can also adjust the steps, times, and ingredients for the next brewing until they have perfected their recipe.
