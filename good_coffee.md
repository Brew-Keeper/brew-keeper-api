##### Good Coffee
Making coffee in a typical coffee maker can be as simple as scooping pre-ground coffee into a filter, pouring water into the reservoir, and turning it on.

##### A Journey to Better Coffee
If you were looking to make better coffee, you might buy specialty beans and even freshly grind them. Even so, those beans may not produce good-tasting coffee in your machine. Besides the beans, the three most important factors in determining coffee flavor are predetermined in most coffee makers: the temperature of the water and the manner in which it is applied to the grounds and how long it is in contact with the grounds. Different beans need different treatment to accentuate their positive features (or minimize negative ones). In addition, everyone's tongue has a slightly different idea of what "best" is. The ideal situation is to have complete control over your coffee making process.  What method should you use to get the best-tasting coffee? As it turns out, the answer to this question is the start of a journey&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.

###### Three Main Keys
* Beans (kind, grind, and amount)
* Water (kind,temperature, and amount)
* Brew Method: combining water and ground coffee in some fashion, then usually separating the liquid from the grounds

##### AeroPress
The AeroPress allows a brewer a great degree of control over their cup of coffee. At first, the range of possibilities can be overwhelmingâ€”not just the possible combinations but also remembering what produced good results. Starting with a bean you are unfamiliar with can be like starting all over again. If only there was a way to keep track of your coffee experimentation&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.

##### Enter Brew Keeper
Brew Keeper provides a way to *_create_*, *_brew_*, *_refine_*, and *_store notes on_* coffee recipes so you can zero in on your best brew for each bean. Recipes store the detailed components of coffee recipes and general notes can hold any additional information that you might not have a place for. This site was designed with the AeroPress in mind, but can easily support other brewing equipment.
