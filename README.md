##### Good Coffee
Making coffee in a typical coffee maker can be as simple as scooping pre-ground coffee into a filter, pouring water into the reservoir, and turning it on.

##### A Journey to Better Coffee
The three most important factors in creating coffee flavor are predetermined in most coffee makers: the temperature of the water, the manner in which it is applied to the grounds, and how long it is in contact with the grounds. To make better coffee, you might buy specialty beans and freshly grind them. Even so, those beans may not produce good-tasting coffee in your machine. In addition, everyone has a different idea of what "better" coffee is. The ideal situation is to have complete control over your coffee-making process. As it turns out, this is the start of a journey&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.

###### Three Main Keys
* Beans (kind, grind, and amount)
* Water (kind, temperature, and amount)
* Brew Method: combining water and ground coffee, then separating the liquid from the grounds

##### AeroPress
The AeroPress allows a brewer a high degree of control over their cup of coffee. At first, the range of possibilities can be overwhelmingâ€”not just the possible combinations but also remembering what produced good results. Starting with a bean you are unfamiliar with can be like starting all over again. If only there was a way to keep track of your coffee experimentation&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.

##### Enter Brew Keeper
Brew Keeper provides a way to **create**, **brew**, **refine**, and **store notes on** coffee recipes so you can zero in on your best brew for each bean. Recipes store the detailed components of coffee recipes and general notes can hold any additional information. This site was designed with the AeroPress in mind, but can easily support other brewing equipment.
